  <p style="color:#654321;">I AM HEZEKIAH ANNE C. FELISILDA, YOU CAN CALL ME KYANA OR KIAN FOR SHORT. I AM 21 YEARS OLD BORN ON DECEMBER 17, 2001. AS A PERSON
I HAVE THE PERSONALITY TO BE SILENT OR TALKATIVE, IT DEPENDS ON MY MOOD IF I HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY I TEND TO BE REALLY TALKATIVE. I OBSERVE A LOT TO MY 
SURROUNDINGS AND ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE AROUND ME. YOU CAN CALL ME AN INTROVERT AT MOST TIMES. BUT USUALLY I'M FUN TO BE WITH LIKE THE "PROBLEM-FREE" PERSON.</p>

  <p style="color:#654321;">MY GUIDING PRINCIPLE IS THAT DO NOT BE SO STRESSED AND STUCKED TO ONE PROBLEM. I AM THAT TYPE OF PERSON THAT IF I CAN'T SOLVE ONE 
PROBLEM ON TIME I DON'T DWELL ON IT TOO MUCH AND IT REALLY STRESSES ME WHEN I DO THAT'S WHY I TAKE A BREAK FIRST AND THEN GO BACK ON IT AGAIN WHEN I THINK OF 
SOMETHING.</p>

  <p style="color:#654321;">ONE OF MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS WHEN I WAS PART OF THE HONORS LIST ON MY JUNIOR HIGHSCHOOL YEARS. ALSO WHEN I WAS PART OF THE SSG 
  NATIONALS WHEN I WAS GRADE 12 STUDENT. WHEN I ALSO JOINED THE PHOTOJOURNALISM EVENT HELD AT THE DR. CECILIO PUTONG SCHOOL.</p>

  <p style="color:#654321;">MY DREAMS AND FUTURE PLANS IS TO GRADUATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH MY CHOSEN COURSE AND TO FIND A COMPANY THAT CAN PAY ME WELL TO PAY 
  BACK MY PARENTS ON HOW MUCH THEY SPENT ON ME AND TO HELP MY BROTHER AND SISTER WITH THEIR SCHOOL. ALSO I PLAN ON WORKING ABROAD.</p>
